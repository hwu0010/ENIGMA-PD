# ENIGMA‑PD Data Annotation Workflow  
All you need to know about using the Neurobagel Annotation Tool

## Why this matters  
As ENIGMA‑PD moves toward sharing richer clinical, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric data across sites, we need a consistent and reliable way to interpret variables. Manual data dictionaries in spreadsheets are prone to typos, inconsistent naming, and misunderstandings about what each variable represents.  
The Neurobagel workflow provides a structured, user‑friendly way to standardize how we describe clinical data, making it easier to reuse datasets, combine them across sites, and support ENIGMA-PD projects with more advanced clinical measures.Expand commentComment on line R6Resolved
In the future, we hope that the standardized annotations will make it easier for ENIGMA-PD to discover data availability across sites for ongoing and new projects.

## 1. ENIGMA‑PD Custom Variable List  
To support harmonized annotation, ENIGMA‑PD created a curated list of PD‑relevant variables. Standard vocabularies in Neurobagel are broad, and many PD‑specific assessments (cognition, motor, neuropsychiatry, behaviour) were missing.  
The ENIGMA‑PD list fills this gap and ensures that all sites annotate their data using the same shared terminology.

This list is a work in progress and will continue to evolve. We are keen to hear from sites if important variables they collect are missing, so we can expand and refine the list together. Please reach out to enigma-pd@amsterdamumc.nl.

### What this step provides
- A consortium‑wide reference list of PD‑specific assessments and clinical variables.  
- A controlled vocabulary that appears directly inside the Neurobagel Annotation Tool.  
- A mechanism for sites to suggest missing variables.

## 2. Annotation using the Neurobagel Tool  
With the ENIGMA‑PD list integrated into the tool, sites can annotate their datasets in a structured and intuitive way.

### What sites do in this step
- Go to [https://beta-annotate.neurobagel.org/](https://beta-annotate.neurobagel.org/)
- Select **ENIGMA-PD** as configuration.
- Upload a TSV file containing demographic and clinical variables.  
- **Column annotation**: assign each column or group of columns to a category by clicking on them.  
  - First, we ask you to assign columns about common demographic categories  (e.g., participant ID, age,  diagnosis, etc) 
  - Next you assign the remaining columns to entries in the ENIGMA-PD list (e.g. MoCA)
- **Value annotation**: for assessment‑related columns, select the matching term from the ENIGMA‑PD list.
  - Mark missing values.  
  - Optionally add short human‑readable descriptions for uncommon variables.  
- Download a standardized annotation file that serves as a clean, robust data dictionary.
- **Privacy note:** although the annotation interface is a web app, it runs entirely on your computer and Neurobagel **does not upload any data or retain data**. Your data are used only to populate the annotation interface (read columns and possible values).

### Why this helps
- Produces a consistent, machine‑readable data dictionary for each cohort.  
- Reduces human error compared to manual data dictionaries. 
(If you make a mistake during annotation, you can simply load your data dictionary into the tool again and correct it)
- Makes datasets easier to understand, reuse, and combine.

## Feedback from early adopters  
- Annotation is straightforward and user‑friendly.  
- The main time investment is **the value annotation step**, selecting the correct variable from the ENIGMA‑PD list.  
- Overall experience: not difficult, but requires some attention to detail.
